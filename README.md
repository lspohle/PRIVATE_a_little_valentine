# [Introduction to the map and your role as a player](#1)
Note that I included [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) as a graphics library, and I used my own [libft](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_a_little_valentine/blob/main/libft) for [printf](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_a_little_valentine/blob/main/libft/ft_printf.c), [memset](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_a_little_valentine/blob/main/libft/ft_memset.c) and [strncmp](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_a_little_valentine/blob/main/libft/ft_strncmp.c). The libft also contains the function [get_next_line](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_a_little_valentine/blob/main/libft/get_next_line_bonus) to read from a file descriptor.
